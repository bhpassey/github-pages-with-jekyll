title: "Triple oxygen isotopes in continental paleoclimate reconstruction"
date: 2020-09-08

The continents are emerging as a particularly fruitful area of application for triple oxygen isotope studies, with 17O values strongly influenced by evaporation, possibly influenced by kinetic fractionation during mineralization, and, for organisms with waters of respiration comprising a large fraction of their overall water budget, by the unique 17O values of atmospheric O2. Triple oxygen isotopes are potentially useful in systems ranging from lakes to soils to caves to plants to animals. At the time of this writing, very little information exists for soils and caves, so we focus our review on lakes, animal body waters, plant waters, and on the isotopic compositions of carbonates and bioapatites forming in natural waters and animals, respectively.
